<div class="error">
    <p>You are seeing this because the URL really could not be responded.</p>
    <p>That was the order of our attempts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Verified if the path <strong><?= $absolute_path ?></strong> exists.</li>
        <li>Verified if there is an index within <strong><?= $absolute_path ?></strong>.</li>
        <li>Verified if there is an index in the document root
            <strong><?= $config['root'] ?></strong> to do an URL Rewrite.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Therefore, this URL does not really exist.</p>

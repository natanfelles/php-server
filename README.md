> See release notes at: https://github.com/natanfelles/php-server/releases

## Installation

### Composer

Open your terminal and run:

```sh
composer global require natanfelles/php-server
```

Add the composer bin path to your *.bashrc*:

```sh
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Manual

Download and extract the *php-server* project folder.

Add the php-server alias to your *.bashrc*:

```sh
echo 'alias php-server="~/php-server/bin/php-server"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Config

You can run the php-server in any folder of your operating system.

Each time you run the *php-server* command, it will look up if there is a file named *php-server.ini* in the current directory. If found, your settings will override the default settings.

A quick example file content is:

```ini
php = PHP_BINARY
host = localhost
port = 8080
root = ./public
autoindex = true
index = index.php
error_reporting = E_ALL

[ini]
display_errors = 1
display_startup_errors = 1
max_execution_time = 360
post_max_size = 200M
upload_max_filesize = 200M
; Array of runtime extensions:
extension[] = mysqli
extension[] = zip

[server]
ENVIRONMENT = development
```

> You can use the command `php-server new` to create a new configuration file in the current directory.

### Explanation

#### General Vars

| Key | Default Value| Description |
| --------------- | --- | --- |
| php | [PHP_BINARY](http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.constants.php#constant.php-binary) | PHP binary path or command |
| host | localhost | Server host |
| port | 8080 | Server host port |
| root | [getcwd()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.getcwd.php) | Document root. The location that will be the public root of your website. |
| autoindex | true | Determines if the server will list directory contents if it does not find an index file. |
| index | index.html index.php | The names of the index files separated by spaces. |
| error_reporting | [E_ALL](http://php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.constants.php#errorfunc.constants.errorlevels.e-all) | Sets the [level of errors](http://php.net/manual/en/function.error-reporting.php) that will be reported. |

#### Sections

| Section | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ini |  Used to set custom [php.ini directives](http://php.net/manual/en/ini.list.php). |
| server | Used to set custom [Server and execution environment information](http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.server.php). |

Knowing this, just create (if necessary) a php-server.ini file, run the server and you're done.

## Run

As you can see in the [config](#config). You can create a php-server.ini file to leave the settings of each project already pre-established.

But, you can also simply run `php-server` and the server will already be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

The php-server command can receive some parameters and they are:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --php | PHP binary path or command  |
| --host | Server host |
| --port | Server host port |
| --root | Document root |

For example, to run the server on a different port:

```sh
php-server --port 8081
```

Or, also with a different version of PHP than the default:

```sh
php-server --php php7.4 --port 8081
```

Right. You get the idea. If you want to run on a different host you can add the host to the [hosts file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)) of your operating system.
